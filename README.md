Tired of staring at a russian flag while your country is being invaded by the russian army, but still need to type with different keyboards including the russian character set? Then just copy the `.keylayout` and `.icns` file into `/Library/Keyboard\ Layouts/` on your Mac! You probably need to reboot and then you may choose the layout under System `Preferences->Keyboard->Input Sources->Add->Others`.

    git clone git@github.com:AndreyMatviyenko/russian-Poop-flag.git
    cd russian-Poop-flag/
    sudo cp russian\.* /Library/Keyboard\ Layouts/ && sudo cp russian\ -\ PC\.* /Library/Keyboard\ Layouts/

### Modify the layout ###
